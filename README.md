# Homebridge Hikvision NVR/DVR Events Plugin

This plugin allows your Hikvision NVR or DVR to raise HTTP events to trigger motion on homebridge-camera-ffmpeg cameras with motion enabled.

Simply configure your NVR host, port, username & password, and configure the URL to push motion events to.

homebridge-camera-ffmpeg must be configured to listen on the equivalent port for HTTP requests, the camera names will be automatically detected.

Update: as of version 1.0.2, DVR's are also supported
```
